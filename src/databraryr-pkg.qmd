# `databraryr` R package

![`databraryr` R package logo](include/img/databraryr-logo.png)

This page summarizes information about the R package the team developed and enhanced with NSF support.

## Background  {-}

Rick Gilmore began development on an R package to use the Databrary PI in 2018.
The original package was called `databraryapi`.
Some of that work was supported by the Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project award supported by NIH under [R01HD094830](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/y_CtF--A5Eq5siGqtwbLiQ/project-details/9500957).

In summer of 2023, Gilmore moved the code base to the Databrary GitHub organization and renamed the package `databraryr` in accord with R package naming conventions.
Gilmore and Spies worked to make the code base more robust and standards compliant.
They submitted the package for review to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) in late September 2023.
The package was approved and made available via CRAN on October 23, 2023.

The package underlies much of the work PI Gilmore has done to make Databrary's data holdings maximally available to the broadest possible community, especially via the Databrary analytics site (<https://databrary.github.io/analytics>).

## Current (0.5.0) release {-}

The R package is available here: <https://https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/databraryr/>

A full website describing all of the commands can be found at <https://databrary.github.io/databraryr/>.

The package is freely available to everyone via the R command `install.packages('databraryr')`.

## Roadmap {-}

We are developing a [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/databrary/projects/5/views/1) for the package.
A major feature for a future release will be commands that enable scripted uploading of data and materials to Databrary.
We are also in the early stages of developing a Python version of the package.
