<h2>Databrary 2.0: Good Practices and Future Directions for FAIR Metadata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#databrary-2.0-good-practices-and-future-directions-for-fair-metadata"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<div id="background-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Background<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Databrary (<a href="https://databrary.org/">https://databrary.org</a>) is a
restricted-access data library for storing, streaming, and sharing video
and audio recordings collected as research data or documentation. Its
primary focus is the collection of data in behavioral, social,
educational, and developmental science. The Databrary 2.0 project,
supported by the National Science Foundation via OAS-2032713, builds on the existing
Databrary platform to ensure its datasets, and the metadata that
describes them, complies with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
reusable) standards through implementation of open metadata schema and
vocabularies, documentation of these guidelines, and outreach to
Databrary stakeholders.</p>
<p>As part of the NSF study, the University Libraries consulted with the
Databrary project team on metadata curation and publishing standards for
research data. Particular attention was paid to the demographic data
describing datasets and their constituent files in the current Databrary
infrastructure, aligning each data property with one or more open schema
in the domain of that property. This report presents the results of this
consultation. It also introduces further practices that the Databrary
project may adopt in order to comply with the FAIR Principles <span class="citation">(<a href="resources.html#ref-Wilkinson2016-qr">Wilkinson et al., 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="databrary-and-the-fair-principles" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Databrary and the FAIR Principles<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#databrary-and-the-fair-principles"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div id="findability" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Findability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#findability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The FAIR principles for findability are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metadata are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier</p></li>
<li><p>Data are described with rich metadata</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data
they describe</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata are registered or indexed in a searchable resource</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Datasets in Databrary are assigned persistent identifiers; the
aggregations of metadata that describe these datasets should be provided
distinct persistent identifiers, so that they may be referenced
separately. The metadata describing resources in Databrary is already
quite rich, but more work may be done to ensure its fitness for the
purposes for which it is used (e.g. self-curation and management of
deposits, discovery of data by outside researchers). The identification
and definition of core and extended sets of data properties that best
facilitate finding and reusing Databrary datasets should be the subject
of future user research studies. Finally, metadata describing Databrary
datasets should be aggregated in such a way that they may be made
available for discovery in searchable resources. This includes Databrary
itself, as well as any third-party data repositories for which Databrary
makes itself available for aggregation. <a href="https://www.fairdatapoint.org/">The FAIR Data Point
project</a> points a way forward for this.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Accessibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#accessibility"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The FAIR principles for accessibility are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Metadata are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized
communications protocol</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization
procedure, where necessary</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Metadata are accessible even when the data are no longer available</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Databrary is in the process of making its metadata available through <a href="https://github.com/databrary/databraryr">an
R package</a> and through an open
API. Determining the data structures for making metadata available
through the API is one of the primary deliverables of the Libraries’
ongoing collaborations with the Databrary project. Databrary is well on
its way to aligning with the FAIR accessibility principles, although in
our work we identified two issues to address in future work. First, the
categories of access restriction that may be placed on data vary even
among individual users or within a single dataset. This has implications
for how accessible data may be for a particular user, or for the degree
to which a metadata aggregation may be visible to a user who requests it
using an API. Databrary will need to keep an internal record of these
permissions; this record will itself need to be published in accordance
with the FAIR Principles, with appropriate identifiers and version
control that can be referenced in a metadata aggregation. Second,
datasets that are no longer available in Databrary for any reason
(withdrawn from the repository; made unavailable to a user due to
changes in circumstances) will still need to have metadata for them made
available. Rationale for the unavailability of this data will need to be
published in a standardized way.</p>
</div>
<div id="interoperability" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Interoperability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interoperability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The FAIR principles for interoperability are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metadata use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable
language for knowledge representation.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata include qualified references to other metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Databrary is in the process of establishing metadata encoding standards
for the various places where metadata aggregations describing its
datasets may be found, including the Databrary website, the API, and the
Databrary R package. Wherever possible, Databrary should refer to
property value sets that are published as open data with persistent,
referenceable URIs to ensure data interoperability. For publishing data
through a publicly-accessible Web frontend, JSON-LD (or JSON for Linking
Data) is a widely-used standard. JSON-LD uses broadly applicable open
vocabularies such as Schema.org to publish metadata property/value pairs
in a way that search engines can recognize and integrate into their
indexes. Examples of metadata aggregations encoded as JSON-LD for the
Web may be found in this report and in the related Metadata
Recommendations document.</p>
<p>In some cases this may come into conflict with the ways in which
researchers and PIs have chosen to collect and document their own data.
For these situations Databrary should have a statement or memorandum of
understanding with depositors allowing for some post-deposit curation of
metadata that prserves the provenance and original order of the data
while allowing for interoperability and shared understanding of data
properties, according to the FAIR standards (see the “Reusability”
section below).</p>
</div>
<div id="reusability" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Reusability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reusability"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The FAIR principles for reusability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Metadata are richly described with a plurality of accurate and
relevant attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Metadata are released with a clear and accessible data usage
license.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata are associated with detailed provenance.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata meet domain-relevant community standards.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The principles regarding rich description using clearly-defined and
relevant data properties are echoed in many of the other FAIR
principles. The application of reusability principles, more so than the
other three categories, follow from researched and documented use cases
for metadata and data collected from the Databrary community, and are
difficult to glean from metadata specialization alone. Data usage
licenses should be implemented in Databrary that meet the needs for both
data sharing among researchers and the protection of privacy for
research subjects. Data provenance, both in the deposit of metadata and
in its ongoing curation (e.g. the enhancement of metadata to conform
with open vocabularies for attributes such as demographic data) should
be documented and made available to aid in the understanding of
datasets. Finally, direct observation of and outreach to researchers, in
particular their needs for sharing data and re-using the shared data of
others, should be considered in developing description practices.</p>

However, the practice has been documented only informally in anecdotal reports. Thus, this study had two research questions: (1) To what extent are infants’ movements restricted in the gahvora? (2) How is time in the gahvora distributed over a 24-hour day in infants from 1–24 months of age? To answer these questions, we video-recorded 146 mothers cradling their infants and interviewed them using 24-hour time diaries to determine the distribution of time infants spent in the gahvora within a day and across age. Infants’ movements were indeed severely restricted. Although mothers showed striking uniformity in how they restricted infants’ movements, they showed large individual differences in amount and distribution of daily use. Machine learning algorithms yielded three patterns of use: day and nighttime cradling, mostly nighttime cradling, and mostly daytime cradling, suggesting multiple functions of the cradling practice. Across age, time in the gahvora decreased, yet 20% of 12- to 24-month-olds spent more than 15 hours bound in the gahvora. We discuss the challenges and benefits of cultural research, and how the discovery of new phenomena may defy Western assumptions about childrearing and development. Future work will determine whether the extent and timing of restriction impacts infants’ physical and psychological development.",

interoperable, reusable) standards through implementation of open
metadata schema and vocabularies, documentation of these guidelines, and
outreach to Databrary stakeholders.</p>
<p>To move toward FAIR compliance, demographic information about
participants in research studies for which data is stored in Databrary
should comply with one or more open schema. Databrary’s internal logic
regarding user privacy and compliance with federal and depositor rules
around health data dictate the terms by which users and user groups may
view certain data properties and values. This permission logic, internal
to Databrary, must also comply with open schema, to be built and
maintained by the Databrary project team.</p>
<p>In furtherance of these goals the University Libraries reviewed the
current demographic data stored about datasets and their constituent
files in the current Databrary infrastructure, aligning each data
property with one or more open schema in the domain of that property.
This alignment will be reviewed by the Databrary team. The University
Libraries also recommend the strategies below for documentation of the
internal permission logic of Databrary, and on the documentation of data
properties and values visible for each entry within that permission
logic scheme.</p>

<p>The uses for which metadata in Databrary are designed are documented on
its GitHub project page (<a href="https://github.com/databrary/metadata" class="uri">https://github.com/databrary/metadata</a>). The
first priority of Databrary’s metadata design is to support open
metadata schema and standards whenever possible. Among the schema
supported by Databrary are the National Insitutes of Health (NIH) Common
Data Elements; DataCite; and schema.org. Open serialization formats
supported by Databrary include JSON-LD and the CSV Schema Language.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting open metadata initiatives, Databrary seeks to
permit self-curation of data by allowing depositors to select the schema
that best represent their data sets. These can be at cross-purposes. For
example, a depositor may have collected data representing demographic
information about project participants that is from a closed scheme, or
one that is proprietary to their own project. To ensure
interoperability, Databrary may require provisions to align such closed
or proprietary schema with selected open schema endorsed by the project.</p>
<p>The <em>PLAY and Learning Across a Year</em> (PLAY) project
(<a href="https://play-project.org" class="uri">https://play-project.org</a>) is a collaborative initiative by 65
researchers across 45 institutions in North America. Its primary purpose
is to document play practices in early childhood development; a
secondary purpose of the project is to model open, collaborative
research and data management practices. To this end Databrary has
documented the demographic data properties for which values are
collected by PLAY.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/databrary/metadata/blob/main/nih-cde.md" class="uri"&gt;https://github.com/databrary/metadata/blob/main/nih-cde.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> These are derived from participant agreements,
pre- and post-visit questionnaires, and data collected at the home
visits themselves.</p>
<p>The PLAY project has two obstacles to ensuring FAIR data publication
practices. The first is the collected data properties, which are not
currently aligned thoroughly with open metadata schema (though work has
been done to align key demographic properties with the NIH Common Data
Elements). The second, and the more difficult to navigate, is the values
assigned to those properties. There are open vocabularies in common use
for assigning demographic values to properties, such as race and
ethnicity, level of educational attainment, and geographical data.
However, Databrary’s desire to allow self-curation of data extends to an
individual researcher or project’s choice of demographic values; this
may be at cross-purposes with a mandate to select a particular
vocabulary for demographic information. Moreover, open schema with fixed
values may not be sufficiently representative for demographic
information such as gender or household structure. Open schema adoption
within Databrary should be balanced against the needs of researchers to
accurately reflect their project participants. <del>To this end the
metadata strategies outlined here should be adopted with the consent of
both researchers and, to the extent possible, project participants,
through participant agreements.</del>Participant agreements may need to be
revised in order to allow participants to consent to the use of metadata
about them for data reuse purposes.</p>

<h3>Recommendations on encoding data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recommendations-on-encoding-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>JSON-LD is a generally accepted standard for performing this work.
JSON-LD is a data exchange format using JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON), a widely accepted format for encoding structured data on the
World Wide Web. JSON-LD is easily recognized by search engines for
indexing and retrieval, and can be used for both general Web searches
using tools like Google or DuckDuckGo as well as specific searches
within scholarly indexes such as Google Scholar.</p>
<div id="an-example-from-the-archives" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>An example from the archives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#an-example-from-the-archives"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>To draw on the example of another discipline, members of the University
Libraries team implement ArchivesSpace as the collection management and
discovery system for archival materials held at both University Park and
the Commonwealth Campus Libraries at Penn State. ArchivesSpace supports
JSON-LD natively through its built-in public user interface, a public
catalog of archival metadata used for search, discovery, and item
retrieval. The public user interface of ArchivesSpace selectively
publishes data from the database, allowing for access to materials
without unauthorized access to information that is of a sensitive nature
(such as the contact or demographic information of donors), not suitable
for public viewing (such as internal collection processing notes or
accession records), or is of a particularly technical nature (such as
digital file checksums).</p>
<p>JSON-LD is embedded within &lt;script&gt; tags in the HTML generated by
ArchivesSpace when a user clicks through to a record. An example of
ArchivesSpace’s JSON-LD, in this case to describe the <a href="https://aspace.libraries.psu.edu/repositories/3/resources/215">T.R. Johns
papers</a>,
is provided below.</p>

<p>While this particular use case of JSON-LD lacks features desired for the
Databrary 2.0 project – it only implements linked data URIs that are
native to the software, and it makes little effort to specify semantic
characteristics of linked subject headings – it points toward a
potential solution for making Databrary data sets more publicly
accessible, and for researchers without Databrary credentials to
identify research data in which they may have an interest.</p>
<p>Schema.org has specific design notes for how it treats <a href="https://schema.org/docs/data-and-datasets.html">data and

However, the practice has been documented only informally in anecdotal reports. Thus, this study had two research questions: (1) To what extent are infants’ movements restricted in the gahvora? (2) How is time in the gahvora distributed over a 24-hour day in infants from 1–24 months of age? To answer these questions, we video-recorded 146 mothers cradling their infants and interviewed them using 24-hour time diaries to determine the distribution of time infants spent in the gahvora within a day and across age. Infants’ movements were indeed severely restricted. Although mothers showed striking uniformity in how they restricted infants’ movements, they showed large individual differences in amount and distribution of daily use. Machine learning algorithms yielded three patterns of use: day and nighttime cradling, mostly nighttime cradling, and mostly daytime cradling, suggesting multiple functions of the cradling practice. Across age, time in the gahvora decreased, yet 20% of 12- to 24-month-olds spent more than 15 hours bound in the gahvora. We discuss the challenges and benefits of cultural research, and how the discovery of new phenomena may defy Western assumptions about childrearing and development. Future work will determine whether the extent and timing of restriction impacts infants’ physical and psychological development.",

<h3>Recommendations on documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recommendations-on-documentation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Visibility of data properties and values within Databrary is driven by
an internal permission logic system. This system controls the extent to
which users may view properties and values for a Databrary project,
based on their status within that project. For example, end users
unaffiliated with a project but who wish to reuse its data would see
only descriptive metadata about the project; PIs or researchers who work
on the project would see a fuller representation of item-level
demographic data. The permission levels are unique to Databrary. These
permissions will be published as an open schema within the Databrary
metadata documentation, and the visibility of each demographic data
property as a function of permission levels will be published as a
property therein across all schema serialization formats.</p>
<p>Documentation of Databrary metadata practices should be done
sufficiently to meet the needs of several stakeholder groups, including
the Databrary project team, researchers or research teams interested in
reusing data sets stored in Databrary or depositing their own, and
metadata professionals seeking to reuse Databrary metadata products in
different discovery systems. The documentation strategies outlined here
should meet the needs of metadata specialists and Databrary project
participants. Other documentation strategies, tailored to the needs of
researchers without a technical background in metadata design, may be
identified through future outreach work.</p>
